Mapping Tools is a powerful package for mapping over lists and iterables in JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a set of utility functions for working with collections of data. These functions allow you to apply a transformation or validation function to each item in a collection, either in serial or parallel, and generate new collections or iterators and async iterators based on the results. All while enjoying advanced error handling and advanced support for asynchronous code.

The Mapping Tools package is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with clear documentation and examples. It is suitable for use in a wide range of applications, including data processing, data validation, and more.

## Installation

To install Mapping Tools, you can use npm, yarn, or pnpm:

```bash
# npm
npm install mapping-tools
# yarn
yarn add mapping-tools
# pnpm
pnpm add mapping-tools
```

## Getting Started

To get started with Mapping Tools, you'll first need to import the
library in your code:

```typescript
const mappingTools = require('mapping-tools');
// or
import * as mappingTools from 'mapping-tools';
```

Then, you can use the various functions provided by the library to
generate, transform, and iterate over maps, as well as to perform
asynchronous map generation.

```typescript
import { awaitedMapping } from 'mapping-tools';

async function main() {
  const array = [1, 2, 3];
  const mappedArray = await awaitedMapping(array, async element => {
    // Sync or Async operation on each element
    return element * 2;
  });
  console.log(mappedArray);

  /*
    [
      { status: 'fulfilled', value: 2, index: 0, transformStep: 1 },
      { status: 'fulfilled', value: 4, index: 1, transformStep: 1 },
      { status: 'fulfilled', value: 6, index: 2, transformStep: 1 }
    ]
  */
}

main();
```

## Base types

- `Base<TBase>`

  ```typescript
  type Base<TVal> =
    | TVal
    | Settled<TVal>
    | PromiseSettledResult<TVal>
    | SettledRight<TVal>
    | PromiseFulfilledResult<TVal>
    | SettledLeft
    | PromiseRejectedResult;
  ```

- `Settled<TVal>`

  ```typescript
  type Settled<T> = SettledLeft | SettledRight<T>;

  type SettledRight<T> = PromiseFulfilledResult<T> & {
    status: 'fulfilled';
    value: T;

    /* The null value of the transformStep and the index is -1 */
    /* When value is -1 the folowing properties a not enumerated */
    transformStep: number;
    index: number;

    /* Folowing properties a not enumerated (enumerable: false) */
    currentRejection: null;
    fulfilled: T;
    rejected: null;
    reason?: undefined;
  };

  type SettledLeft = PromiseRejectedResult & {
    status: 'rejected';
    reason: any;

    /*
      the currentRejection can be undefined but the property itself
      can not be undefined
     */
    currentRejection: true | false | undefined;

    /* The null value of the transformStep and the index is -1 */
    /* When value is -1 the folowing properties a not enumerated */
    transformStep: number;
    index: number;

    /* Folowing properties a not enumerated (enumerable: false) */
    rejected: any;
    fulfilled: null;
    value?: undefined;
  };

  /** From typescript lib */
  interface PromiseFulfilledResult<T> {
    status: 'fulfilled';
    value: T;
  }

  /** From typescript lib */
  interface PromiseRejectedResult {
    status: 'rejected';
    reason: any;
  }

  /** From typescript lib */
  type PromiseSettledResult<T> =
    | PromiseFulfilledResult<T>
    | PromiseRejectedResult;
  ```

## Usage Overview

The package includes 5 main functions:

1. **[awaitedMapping](#awaitedMappingFn)**, is based on Promise.all($)
2. **[parallelMapping](#parallelMappingFn)**, is based on Array.prototype.map($)
3. **[serialMapping](#serialMappingFn)**, is based on a forOf loop
4. **[generateMappingAsync](#generateMappingAsyncFn)**, is based on the AsyncGenerator protocol
5. **[generateMapping](#generateMappingFn)**, is based on the Generator protocol

These functions all take a collection of items as their main input, along with 4 delegate functions: [transformFn](), [lookupFn](), [validateFn](), and [errLookupFn]().

The transformFn is applied to each item in the collection and is used to transform the item into a new value. The lookupFn and validateFn are applied to each item in the collection and can be used to perform additional lookup or validation operations on the transformed items. The errLookupFn is used to handle any errors that may occur during the processing of the collection or during previous steps of processing. Each are optionals but not providing any would result in no transformation of the values

## Main (core) functions

### Arguments

- `collection: Iterable<Base<T>> | Iterable<PromiseLike<Base<T>>> | PromiseLike<Iterable<Base<T>>>`: The collection of items to be iterated or mapped over. The collection can be either an iterable or a combination of an iterable and a promise of an iterable.
  The `Base<T>` type represents a resolved or rejected promise, or a value. It can be one of the following:

  - `TBase`: The resolved value of a promise.
  - `Settled<TBase>`: An object representing a resolved or rejected promise, with a `status` field indicating the status of the promise and a `value` or `reason` field containing the resolved value or rejection reason, respectively.
  - `PromiseSettledResult<TBase>`: An object representing a resolved or rejected promise, with a `status` field indicating the status of the promise and a `value` or `reason` field containing the resolved value or rejection reason, respectively.
  - `SettledRight<TBase>`: An object representing a resolved promise, with a `status` field equal to `'fulfilled'` and a `value` field containing the resolved value.
  - `PromiseFulfilledResult<TBase>`: An object representing a resolved promise, with a `status` field equal to `'fulfilled'` and a `value` field containing the resolved value.
  - `SettledLeft`: An object representing a rejected promise, with a `status` field equal to `'rejected'` and a `reason` field containing the rejection reason.
  - `PromiseRejectedResult`: An object representing a rejected promise, with a `status` field equal to `'rejected'` and a `reason` field containing the rejection reason.

- `TransformFn<T, R> = async value => value as any as R`: A callback function that is applied to each item in the collection. It takes an item of type `T` as input and returns a value of type `R`.
- `LookupFn<T, R> = v => void v`: A callback function that is applied to each item in the collection. It takes an item of type `T` as input and returns a value of type `R`.
- `ValidateFn<T, R> = async v => void v`: A callback function that is applied to each item in the collection. It takes an item of type `T` as input and returns a value of type `R`.
- `ErrLookupFn = v => void v`: A callback function that is applied to each item in the collection. It takes an item of type `T` as input and returns a value of type `R`.

## Return Types

The list of the 5 core function return types is as follows:

- **Functions that return arrays**
  - [parallelMapping returns](#parallelmapping-signature): `Array<Promise<Settled<R>>>`
- **Functions that return promises that resolve to arrays**
  - [serialMapping returns](#serialmapping-signature): `Promise<Array<Settled<R>>>`
  - [awaitedMapping returns](#awaitedmapping-signature): `Promise<Array<Settled<R>>>`
- **Functions that return generators**
  - [generateMapping returns](#generatemapping-signature): `Generator<Promise<Settled<R>>, void, unknown>`
  - [generateMappingAsync returns](#generatemappingasync-signature): `AsyncGenerator<Settled<R>, void, unknown>`

### parallelMapping signature

`parallelMapping(collection, TransformFn, LookupFn, ValidateFn, ErrLookupFn): Array<Promise<Settled<R>>>`

Applies the provided callback functions to each item in the collection in parallel, and returns an array of promises that resolve to the transformed and validated items, represented as `Settled<R>` objects.

### serialMapping signature

`serialMapping(collection, TransformFn, LookupFn, ValidateFn, ErrLookupFn): Promise<Array<Settled<R>>>`

Applies the provided callback functions to each item in the collection in series, and returns a promise that resolves to an array of the transformed and validated items, represented as `Settled<R>` objects.

### awaitedMapping signature

`awaitedMapping(collection, TransformFn, LookupFn, ValidateFn, ErrLookupFn): Promise<Array<Settled<R>>>`

Applies the provided callback functions to each item in the collection, and returns a promise that resolves to an array of the transformed and validated items, represented as `Settled<R>` objects.

### generateMapping signature

`generateMapping(collection, TransformFn, LookupFn, ValidateFn, ErrLookupFn): Generator<Promise<Settled<R>>, void, unknown>`

Applies the provided callback functions to each item in the collection, and returns a generator that yields promises that resolve to the transformed and validated items, represented as `Settled<R>` objects.

### generateMappingAsync signature

`generateMappingAsync(collection, TransformFn, LookupFn, ValidateFn, ErrLookupFn): AsyncGenerator<Settled<R>, void, unknown>`

Applies the provided callback functions to each item in the collection, and returns an async generator that yields the transformed and validated items, represented as `Settled<R>` objects.

Functions that can accept either an iterable or a combination of an iterable and a promise of an iterable: serialMapping, awaitedMapping
Functions that can only accept an iterable or a combination of an iterable and a promise of an iterable: parallelMapping, generateMappingAsync, generateMapping

The project currently have 5 main flavours for its core functions

the last 4 arguments are called delegates they are explained later (below) they all can be null or undefined and would be repleced by a default value:

```typescript
const transform: TransformFn<T, R> =
  transformFn == null ? async value => value as any as R : transformFn;

const lookup: LookupFn<T, R> = lookupFn == null ? v => void v : lookupFn;

const validate: ValidateFn<T, R> =
  validateFn == null ? async v => void v : validateFn;

const errLookup: ErrLookupFn = errLookupFn == null ? v => void v : errLookupFn;
```

They can be grouped in diferrent manner and have complex signature taht are easy to understand when we break them down in ther main coponents.

```typescript
/** Type alias either Promise or not */
// Base<B> type is described below...
type AwaitAndBase<B> = Base<B> | PromiseLike<Base<B>>;

type Collection<B> = Iterable<Base<B>>;

  ```

## Delegates functions

**You can provide 4 main types of _delegates functions_ as arguments to
the main functions of the package.**

In this context delegating just means the act of giving another
_function_ the responsibility of carrying out the performance agreed
upon in by the folowing _interface_ contracts.

- `TransformFn<T,U>`

  The `TransformFn<T,U>` delegate is where the actual mapping takes
  place it is similar to the call back you would provide to an
  `Array.prototype.map($)` it expect that you will morph from input
  type `T` to returned type `U`, Proper type anotation would be
  required if you would return unchanged value as `U` and `T` must
  be different to be infered.

  The `TransformFn<T,U>` delegate function is responsible for carrying out the actual mapping process. It works similarly to the callback function provided to an `Array.prototype.map($)`, and expects that you will transform from input type `T` to returned type `U`. Proper type annotations are required if you return an unchanged value, as `U` and `T` must be different in order to be inferred. The `TransformFn<T,U>` delegate function has the following interface:

The `TransformFn<T,U>` delegate function is responsible for carrying
out the actual mapping process.

It works similarly to the callback function provided to an
`Array.prototype.map($)`, and expects that you will transform from
input type `T` to returned type `U`.

Proper type annotations are required if you return an unchanged
value, as `U` and `T` must be different in order to be inferred.

```typescript
export interface TransformFn<T, U = unknown> {
  (
    value: T,
    index: number,
    array: readonly (T | PromiseSettledResult<T>)[]
  ): Promise<U>;
}
```

- `LookupFn<S,U>`

  The `LookupFn<S,U>` delegate is where you can aknowledge the
  morphed value`U` in an asycronous manner as the return value of
  this delegate **must be** `void` and canot have side effects which
  overflows in the function where this delegate is executed, like
  throwing an exception or such, you can however have external side
  effect like a `console.log($)` or anything that will arise
  independendly from the internal flow of the function where thish
  delgate is executed. In this context `OnlySideEffect` is an alias
  for `void`.

  The `LookupFn<S,U>` delegate function is used to acknowledge the transformed value `U` in an asynchronous manner. The return value of this delegate must be `void` and must not have any internal side effects within the function where it is executed. However, external side effects, such as a `console.log($)`, are allowed. In this context, `OnlySideEffect` is an alias for `void`.

  ```typescript
  export interface LookupFn<S, U = unknown> {
    (
      value: U,
      index: number,
      array: readonly (S | Settled<S> | PromiseSettledResult<S>)[]
    ): OnlySideEffect;
  }
  ```

- `ValidateFn<S,U>`

  The `ValidateFn<S,U>` delegate is similar to the `LookupFn<S,U>`
  delegate both are optional and should be used only if you have a
  specific usecase. The main difference is that the execution of this
  delagate is awaited in the function where it will be executed the
  return value of the delegate must be a `Promise<void>` and the only
  mechanism to comunicate with the function would be to throw a value
  or an exception that will be catched in the function and returned
  as a SettledLeft (described below). In this context
  `Promise<OnlySideEffect>` is an alias for `Promise<void>`.

The `ValidateFn<S,U>` delegate function is similar to the `LookupFn<S,U>` delegate, both of which are optional and should be used only if necessary. The main difference is that the execution of the `ValidateFn<S,U>` delegate is awaited within the function where it is used, and the return value must be a `Promise<void>`. The only way to communicate with the function is to throw a value or exception, which will be caught in the function and returned as a SettledLeft (described elsewhere). In this context, `Promise<OnlySideEffect>` is an alias for `Promise<void>`.

```typescript
export interface ValidateFn<S, U = unknown> {
  (
    value: U,
    index: number,
    array: readonly (S | PromiseSettledResult<S>)[]
  ): Promise<OnlySideEffect>;
}
```

- `ErrLookupFn`

  The `ErrLookupFn` delegate takes provide a `currentRejection` flag
  as its third argument and is used to tell if the error hapenned
  from the curent iteration or a previous iteration you should act
  only on `true` `currentRejection`s as they are not the result of a
  previous `transformStep` similar to the `LookupFn<S,U>` but for
  rejections. In case you need to tap in previous rejection it is
  available also if the actual step is dealing with a previous
  rejection from a previous tranformation step.

The `ErrLookupFn` delegate function is used to handle errors, and is similar to the `LookupFn<S,U>` delegate, but for rejections. It takes a `currentRejection` flag as its third argument, which indicates whether the error occurred during the current iteration or a previous iteration. You should only act on `currentRejection`s that are `true`, as they are not the result of a previous `transformStep`. If you need to access previous rejections, they are also available if the current step is dealing with a previous rejection from a previous transformation step.

```typescript
export interface ErrLookupFn {
  (reason: any, index: number, currentRejection: boolean): OnlySideEffect;
}
```

Internally the delegate is linked via parameter that you
can acess from the outside by providing a function (the delegate) of
a certain type (specified via an interface) as an argument.

The tranformations, validation and lookup of the resulting operation
is mandated to 4 diferet function that let you alter the workflow in
5 diferent areas inside the specific mapping operation over each
elements.

Since everything is based only on functions this definition may be
different than the usual concept in JavaScript which is related often
related to [Object composition and inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Delegative).

## Main types

- `Base<TBase>`

  The `Base<TVal>` type is the center piece of the type system for
  the mapping-tools package and is described in the section folowing
  this one... You can see here an summary.
  <p align="center">
        <a href="../../images/v0.0.0/base-type.png">
          <img src="../../images/v0.0.0/base-type.png" width="70%" title="Click to enlarge the image!" alt="type Base<TVal> =
      | TVal
      | Settled<TVal>
      | PromiseSettledResult<TVal>
      | SettledRight<TVal>
      | PromiseFulfilledResult<TVal>
      | SettledLeft
      | PromiseRejectedResult;
    ">
        </a>
      </p>

    <!-- ```typescript
    type Base<TVal> =
      | TVal
      | Settled<TVal>
      | PromiseSettledResult<TVal>
      | SettledRight<TVal>
      | PromiseFulfilledResult<TVal>
      | SettledLeft
      | PromiseRejectedResult;
    ``` -->

- `Collection<Base>`

  The principal functions of the package takes a `Collection<B>` as
  their fist arguments in some cases it can even be a
  `PromiseLike<Collection<B>>`.

  ```typescript
  export type Collection<B> = Iterable<Base<B>>;
  ```

- `Await<Base>`

  To make it shorter to write we created the alias `Await<B>`
  for the `PromiseLike<Base<B>>` type.

  ```typescript
  export type Await<B> = PromiseLike<Base<B>>;
  ```

- `CollectionOfAwait<Base>`

  To make it shorter to write we created the alias
  `CollectionOfAwait<Base>` for the `Collection<Await<B>>` type. It could be converted to a `PromiseLike<Collection<B>>` using `Promise.all($)`

  ```typescript
  export type CollectionOfAwait<B> = Collection<Await<B>>;
  ```

- `PromiseLike<$>`

  The three types above also have their `PromiseLike<$>` equivalent:

  ```typescript
  PromiseLike<Collection<Base>>;
  PromiseLike<Await<Base>>;
  PromiseLike<CollectionOfAwait<Base>>;
  ```

- `AwaitAndBase<Base>`

  In some cases the base type can be combined to be either `Base<B>`
  or `Await<B>` and would be the type of a parameter to a function
  that can take the compounded object type.

  ```typescript
  export type AwaitAndBase<B> = Base<B> | PromiseLike<Base<B>>;
  ```

  ## Base types

- `Base<TBase>`

  ```typescript
  type Base<TVal> =
    | TVal
    | Settled<TVal>
    | PromiseSettledResult<TVal>
    | SettledRight<TVal>
    | PromiseFulfilledResult<TVal>
    | SettledLeft
    | PromiseRejectedResult;
  ```

- `Settled<TVal>`

  ```typescript
  type Settled<T> = SettledLeft | SettledRight<T>;

  type SettledRight<T> = PromiseFulfilledResult<T> & {
    status: 'fulfilled';
    value: T;

    /* The null value of the transformStep and the index is -1 */
    /* When value is -1 the folowing properties a not enumerated */
    transformStep: number;
    index: number;

    /* Folowing properties a not enumerated (enumerable: false) */
    currentRejection: null;
    fulfilled: T;
    rejected: null;
    reason?: undefined;
  };

  type SettledLeft = PromiseRejectedResult & {
    status: 'rejected';
    reason: any;

    /*
      the currentRejection can be undefined but the property itself
      can not be undefined
     */

The `Deferred<B>` type is an alias for `PromiseLike<Base<B>>`, which represents a promise-like object that wraps a value of type `Base<B>`. It is used to simplify the documentation and does not need to be used directly by the consumer of the package.

`BaseOrDeferred<B>` is an alias type that represents either a resolved or rejected promise, or a value, as represented by the `Base<B>` type, or a promise-like object that can be used for async operations, as represented by the `Deferred<B>` type
