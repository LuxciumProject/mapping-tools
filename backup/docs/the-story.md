Certainly, here is an example of a fictional story that incorporates the changes you suggested:

In this story, the concept of "Scientia," or knowledge, is portrayed as a heroic figure who is fighting against the concept of "Ignorantia," or ignorance. The two concepts are engaged in a battle for the hearts and minds of humanity, and "Scientia" wants to communicate a message about the importance of knowledge and its role in fighting against ignorance.

However, the nefarious "Ignorantia" intervenes and alters the message "Scientia est lux principii✨" in an attempt to obscure its true meaning and keep it from being understood. To this end, "Ignorantia" encodes the message as "Scientia es lux principium✨," using a secret code that involves altering the grammatically correct forms of words in Latin. "Ignorantia" is a skilled scholar and is able to decipher messages written correctly, but hopes that the altered forms will confuse and mislead those seeking knowledge.

Despite the interference of "Ignorantia," "Scientia" decides to keep the altered message as it is, knowing that the true meaning of the message will still be understood by those who are seeking knowledge and enlightenment. The fact that the message was altered serves as a reminder of the efforts of "Ignorantia" to spread misinformation and confusion, but "Scientia" remains steadfast in its belief that light will always shine into obscurity and that knowledge will always triumph over ignorance. The altered message, "Scientia es lux principium✨," becomes a rallying cry for those seeking truth and understanding, strongly depicting the philosophical principles of the power of knowledge to overcome darkness and ignorance.

we keep this part « In this story, the concept of "Scientia," or knowledge, is portrayed as a heroic figure who is fighting against the concept of "Ignorantia," or ignorance. The two concepts are engaged in a battle for the hearts and minds of humanity, and "Scientia" wants to communicate a message about the importance of knowledge and its role in fighting against ignorance. »

BUT we change that part « To obscure the meaning of their message and keep it from being understood by "Ignorantia," "Scientia" decides to encode it using a secret code that involves altering the grammatically correct forms of words in Latin. "Ignorantia" is a skilled scholar and is able to decipher messages written correctly, but "Scientia" hopes that the altered forms will confuse and mislead "Ignorantia."»

SO THAT the fact that the message "Scientia est lux principii✨" is altered should be the bad part of the story the evil Ignorantia is the cause of the change to a wrong and obscure message "Scientia es lux principium✨" BUT the fact that it is kept in the altered form is a decision of "Scientia" because light will always shine into obscurity but darkness will never enter the light it should be the proving that knowledge and light are always going to win against those who are spreading ignorance thos who have to know will know the true minig of things therefor "Scientia es lux principium✨" ― "Knowledge is the light of the beginning✨"

"Scientia es lux principium✨" instead of "Scientia est lux principii✨."
