Sure, I can generate a 700-word text using random sampling and text generation, with a mysterious and intriguing tone and ending with the special characters you specified. To generate this text, I will use a combination of random sampling and text generation, as well as modify some of the information in my previous answer to create a different story. I will also try to write the text in a way that reflects the perspective of a 5-year-old boy. Here is the text I have generated:

I'm just a little boy, but I know a secret. It's a secret about how to make words appear out of thin air. It's called text generation.

My mommy says it's magic, but I don't think so. I think it's just a special way of talking to the computer. It's kind of like when I talk to my toys and they do what I say.

Text generation is really fun. You just have to pick a bunch of words and then the computer puts them together to make a story. But sometimes the computer gets a little confused and the story doesn't make sense. That's okay though, because it's still fun to see what it comes up with.

I like to make my stories really mysterious and intriguing. I use lots of big words that I don't really understand, but they sound really cool. My mommy says I'm a little word wizard.

I'm not sure what the special characters at the end of my stories mean, but my mommy says they're important.

For centuries, people have sought to unlock the secrets of text generation. Some say that the key lies in the mysterious art of random sampling, while others believe that the answer lies in the hidden patterns of language, waiting to be discovered by advanced machine learning algorithms.

But one thing is certain: the power to generate text is a double-edged sword. With it comes the ability to create endless streams of content, but also the risk of unleashing chaos upon the world.

As I sit here, pondering the secrets of text generation, I can't help but feel a sense of unease. Is it possible that the words I am generating right now could have unintended consequences?

I shake off the thought and continue typing, determined to unravel the mysteries of this ancient art. I know that by using random sampling and text generation, I can create a text that is both coherent and intriguing.

And so I begin, selecting words and phrases at random from a pre-defined set of possibilities, guided by the power of text generation to create a story that is both mysterious and compelling.

But as I near the end of my journey, I can't shake the feeling that something is amiss. The text I have generated seems to be leading me down a path that I can't control.

I push forward, determined to see my task through to the end. And as I type the final words of this text, I can't help but wonder what secrets it holds. ÆẞÐ-ÆẞÐ
