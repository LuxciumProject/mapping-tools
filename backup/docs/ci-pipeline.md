# CI Pipeline

Here's a general list of tasks that you can include in your CI pipeline, when building it using code you wrote yourself:

## TODO

- Code repository setup: You'll need to set up a code repository where you'll store your code, and configure it to trigger the CI pipeline when changes are pushed to it.
- Build process: You'll need to write code that automates the build process for your app. This could include tasks such as compiling, transpiling, or bundling your code.
- Test process: You'll need to write code that automates the testing of your app. This could include tasks such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
- Code analysis: You'll need to write code that performs code analysis tasks such as linting and static code analysis.
- Deployment: You'll need to write code that automates the deployment of your app to different environments such as development, staging, and production.
- Notifications: You'll need to write code that sends notifications when the CI pipeline is triggered, and when it completes successfully or fails.
- Reporting: You'll need to write code that generates reports on the results of the CI pipeline, including build and test results, code analysis results, and deployment status.
- Security analysis: You'll need to write code that performs security analysis tasks such as vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing.

These are just some general tasks that you can include in your CI pipeline, and you might need to add more or remove some of them depending on the specific requirements of your app.
