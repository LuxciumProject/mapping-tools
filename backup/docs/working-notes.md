awaitedMapping is based on Promise.all($), allowing you to easily map over asynchronous iterables.
paralellMapping is based on Array.prototype.map($), allowing you to map over iterables in parallel.
serialMapping is based on a forOf loop, allowing you to map over iterables serially.
generateMappingAsync is based on the AsyncGenerator protocol, allowing you to map over iterables asynchronously using generator functions.
generateMapping is based on the Generator protocol, allowing you to map over iterables using generator functions.
With these tools at your disposal, you'll have everything you need to easily and effectively transform your data. We hope "mapping-tools" proves useful in your projects!

"mapping-tools" is a JavaScript package that provides a set of tools for mapping over a list, with a focus on asynchronous code and advanced error handling capabilities.

With "mapping-tools", you can choose from five different methods for mapping over an iterable or array:

Welcome to [Package Name]! This package provides a set of tools for mapping over a list in JavaScript, with a focus on asynchronous code and advanced error handling capabilities.

"mapping-tools" is a powerful and versatile tool that can help you solve a wide variety of problems related to asynchronous code. Whether you're working with complex data structures or need advanced error handling capabilities, "mapping-tools" has you covered.
Provides 5 unique ways to map on an iterable, asynchronously and with advanced error handling capabilities: Using a similar interface it allows you to seemingly map `Generator` and `AsyncGenerator` protocols, the `Array.prototype.map($)` alone or in conjunction with `Promise.all($)`, finally it can use the `for...of` loop...
