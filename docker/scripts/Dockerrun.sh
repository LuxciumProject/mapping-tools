# This approach has been far more effective at facilitating testing for this project.

# can you explicitly tell the AI that I need to have help to create a customized:
#1) Dockerfile to set in stone a secondary project that is in a special folder it would contain
# a) a package.json  a tsconfig file  abd a src folder with a typescript project to test a file (the package ending with .tgz that will be provided as a commandline argument later)
# b) the Dockerfile contains many arguments that would be determined at the docker build step like the nodejs version and typescript version to be installed in the project (the nodejs is not installed per say in fact it is the base FROM argument which would have a default version of 18 but could be change in the docker build command line) so that I can create many diferent test environement targeting doferent nodeJS or typescript versions...
# c) some env parmeters would be provided to the docker run  step like the path to the newly created (npm pack) package to be tested so that I can use my previously created images to test diferent versions of my package using the same isolated and standardised image previously created...
# d) the docker run command would do the compilation of the typescript project (maybe from a preset package.json script with npm run build or such)
# e) after the container is runing I should be able to interact with the compiled javascript package to run some performance tests or integration tests in a standardised manner and in a completely isolated environnement

# a) Dockerfile set a part of the steps
# b) docker build give some ARG to create different standardized images
# c) docker run install the recent package (my library I am working on that was created using NPM pack) and then build the typescript testing project into the javascript isolated test environnement the build step of the typescript project is part of the tests so the failure should be logged or reported but the success should permit to go to the following steps
# d) the environnement inside the container is still running and the NodeJS compiled version is ready to receive commands (maybe using the package.json scripts or the NPM run command or an other mean internally to run tests (performance or integration)...

# 2) please help me explain this in a concise manner as part of my template please correct any repetitions or redundancies in my explanation... please make it clear and explicit to the AI that it will be a pipeline that is configured in steps in the a) Dockerfile b) the docker build step wich install a precise base version of node js and which install a specific version of typescript c) the docker run step which will provide the package (.tgz) to replace in the dependencies to the project and strat the build process of the internal typescript project with the current (newly created .tgz package provided from outside the container) d) if the build step (in the docker run meaning the build of the nodejs project with the npm package to be tested) it the build succeed then the container should not stop an wait to have more instructions to perform tests included into the newly build javascript project in the container

# Yes, I can help you explain your project in a concise and clear manner to the AI assistant.

# Project Name: NPM Package Automation Pipeline
# Project Description: An automation pipeline for creating a npm package using Fedora KDE Plasma shell, Visual Studio Code, and Docker for isolated and standardized testing.
# Tools Used: Fedora KDE Plasma shell, Visual Studio Code, npm, Docker
# Current Stage of Project: Just after unit testing, coverage, and documentation. Have used "npm pack" command to package the project.
# Specific Use of Docker Container: Using a secondary project isolated in a Docker folder as an isolated and standardized test environment for the npm package. This includes:

# Creating a customized Dockerfile that sets up a secondary project in a special folder, containing a package.json, tsconfig file and a src folder with a TypeScript project to test a file (the package ending with .tgz that will be provided as a command-line argument later).
# Using the Dockerfile to create different standardized images by providing different arguments such as the Node.js and TypeScript version to be installed in the project.
# Using the docker run command to install the recent package (created using npm pack) and build the TypeScript testing project into the JavaScript isolated test environment. The build step is part of the tests, and failure should be logged or reported.
# If the build step is successful, the container should not stop and wait for more instructions to perform tests included in the newly built JavaScript project inside the container.
# Please let me know if there is anything else you would like me to include in the template.


# do you not think you forgot to mention something important?




# PLEASE GIVE ME THE TEMPLATE AGAIN WITH ANY MODIFICATIONS IF ANY OR AS IS IF NO MODIFICATIONS ARE MADE!!!
