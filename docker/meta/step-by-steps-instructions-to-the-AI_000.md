# Create a docker Pipeline to Test Typescript Project

## To create a customized Dockerfile and commands for building and running a secondary project, please use the following instructions for the next session of the AI Assistant

```markdown
a) Create a Dockerfile template that includes the following steps:
Copy code

1. Specify the base image to use (e.g. FROM node:18)
2. Copy the project files from host to container (e.g. COPY . . )
3. Install dependencies (e.g. RUN npm install)
4. Define environment variables if necessary (e.g. ENV NODE_ENV=development)
5. Expose any necessary ports (e.g. EXPOSE 3000)
6. Specify a command to run when the container starts (e.g. CMD ["npm", "start"])
```

## b) Create a command to build the image, including any arguments that can be passed at build time (e.g. --build-arg NODE_VERSION=18)

```markdown
7. Use the command "docker build" and specify the path to the Dockerfile (e.g. "docker build -t my-image -f /path/to/Dockerfile .")
8. Pass any necessary build arguments (e.g. "docker build --build-arg NODE_VERSION=14 -t my-image -f /path/to/Dockerfile .")
```

## c) Create a command to run the container, including any necessary arguments for installing the package and building the TypeScript project

```markdown
9.  Use the command "docker run" and specify the image name (e.g. "docker run -it --rm my-image") 10. Mount the package to be tested as a volume (e.g. "docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/package.tgz:/app/package.tgz my-image") 11. Run the build command for the TypeScript project (e.g. "docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/package.tgz:/app/package.tgz my-image npm run build")
```

## d) Once the container is running, you can use the command "docker exec" to run commands inside the container and interact with the compiled JavaScript package

```markdown
12. Use the command "docker exec -it [container name] [command]" (e.g. "docker exec -it my-container-1 npm test")
13. Use any necessary package.json scripts or NPM run commands to run performance or integration tests.
```

## Note

Make sure to include any necessary error handling and logging in the commands. Also, make sure that the AI includes the path to the package.json and config file so that the AI can include the compilation step in the build step and run the tests.

The first project can be referred to as the "main project" or "development project" as it is the project that you are actively working on and developing.

The second project can be referred to as the "testing pipeline project" or "docker pipeline project" as it is used to build the test pipeline for the main project using Docker.
