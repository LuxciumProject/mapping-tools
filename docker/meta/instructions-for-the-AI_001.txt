Create a customized Dockerfile to set up a secondary project in a specific folder. The project should contain:

a package.json
a config file
an src folder with a typescript project to test a file (provided as a command line argument later)
In the Dockerfile, include arguments for the NodeJS and typescript versions to be installed in the project. These arguments can be determined at the docker build step and allow for different test environments targeting different NodeJS or typescript versions.

When running the docker build command, provide env parameters such as the path to the newly created (npm pack) package to be tested. This allows for testing different versions of the package using the same isolated and standardized image previously created.

When running the docker run command, it should do the compilation of the typescript project and after the container is running, one should be able to interact with the compiled javascript package to run performance or integration tests in a standardized and isolated environment.
