Mapping Tools
Mapping Tools is a JavaScript package that provides five main functions for mapping over an iterable or array:

awaitedMapping, which is based on Promise.all($)
parallelMapping, which is based on Array.prototype.map($)
serialMapping, which is based on a forOf loop
generateMappingAsync, which is based on the AsyncGenerator protocol
generateMapping, which is based on the Generator protocol
Each of these functions can accept the following arguments:

A Collection, which is the iterable or array that you want to map over
Four delegate functions:
A mapping function, which is applied to each element of the Collection
An error handling function, which is called if an error occurs during the mapping process
A completion function, which is called when the mapping process is complete
A cancellation function, which is called if the mapping process is cancelled
Here's an example of how you could use the awaitedMapping function:

Copy code
import { awaitedMapping } from 'mapping-tools';

const collection = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

await awaitedMapping(collection, async (item) => {
  // Perform some async operation on each item in the collection
  const result = await someAsyncOperation(item);
  console.log(result);
}, (error) => {
  // Handle any errors that occur during the mapping process
  console.error(error);
}, () => {
  // Do something when the mapping process is complete
  console.log('Mapping complete!');
}, () => {
  // Do something if the mapping process is cancelled
  console.log('Mapping cancelled!');
});
