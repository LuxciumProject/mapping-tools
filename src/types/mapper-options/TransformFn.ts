The TransformFn interface defines a function that can be used to transform a value in a collection. This function takes three arguments:

value: The current value being processed in the collection.
index: The index of the current value in the collection.
array: The array being processed.
The function returns a promise that resolves to the transformed value. This function can be used in conjunction with other functions in the package to apply transformations to a collection of values asynchronously.
