/**
 * The {@link Settled} has either a {@link SettledLeft} or a {@link SettledRight} and is based on the JavaScript {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled | Promise.allSettled()} API only objective is to keep the possible failures of a task separated from the expected completion and extend  PromiseSettledResult
 *
 * @see {@link SettledLeft} and {@link SettledRight}.
 * @typeParam TBase - Represents the type of value contained in a sucesfulll (fulfilled) completion.
 * @remarks
 * The interface Settled<T> is the equivalent of
 * PromiseSettledResult<T> with aditional properties to make it
 * isometric and properties adding Cardinal and Ordinal indexes.
 *
 * The `index` measure the number of elements in a set, giving also its order or position.
 *
 * The `transformStep` measure the order of the steps involved in sucessive completions. first second third.
 *
 * Those two properties are ortogonales in the sens that sucessive
 * elements have an index always the same and each completion steps
 * have a same `transformStep` count they are ortogonal in that aspect
 *
 * ```typescript
 *  type Settled<T> = SettledLeft | SettledRight<T>;
 *
 *  type SettledRight<T> = PromiseFulfilledResult<T> & {
 *    status: 'fulfilled';
 *    value: T;
 *
 *    \/* The null value of the transformStep and the index is -1 *\/
 *    \/* When value is -1 the folowing properties a not enumerated *\/
 *    transformStep: number;
