External link resolvers defined with addUnknownSymbolResolver will now be checked when resolving @link tags, #2030. Note: To support this, resolution will now happen during conversion, and as such, Renderer.addUnknownSymbolResolver has been soft deprecated in favor of Converter.addUnknownSymbolResolver.

@nazarhussain
v0.23.9 (2022-07-24)
Bug Fixes
TypeDoc will no longer skip entry points which have no exports, #2007. If using "entryPointStrategy": "expand", this change may result in new pages being added to your documentation. If this is not desired, you can use the exclude option to filter them out.
Fixed missing comments on callable variable-functions constructed indirectly, #2008.
Packages mode will now respect the --includeVersion flag, #2010.
Fixed multiple reflections mapping to the same file name on case insensitive file systems, #2012.

v0.23.6 (2022-07-08)
Features
Improved support for --entryPointStrategy Packages. TypeDoc will now load package-specific configurations from package.json typedoc field. This configuration allows configuring a custom display name (typedoc.displayName) field, entry point (typedoc.entryPoint - this is equivalent and will override typedocMain), and path to a readme file to be rendered at the top of the package page (typedoc.readmeFile), #1658.
The --includeVersion option will now be respected by --entryPointStrategy Packages. Also, for this combination, missing version field in the root package.json will not issue a warning.
The navigation partial will now call the new settings, primaryNavigation, and secondaryNavigation partials, #1987.
Bug Fixes
All warnings will be reported instead of only the first warning of a given type, #1981.

If a declaration has multiple comments associated with it, the last one should be used, #1961.
v0.23.0 (2022-06-26)
Breaking Changes
Node 12 is no longer officially supported as it has gone end of life as of 2022-04-30. It might still work, but may stop working at any time.
Dropped support for TypeScript before 4.6.
{@link} tags in comments will now be resolved as declaration references similar to TSDoc's declaration references. For most cases, this will just work. See the documentation for details on how link resolution works.
TypeDoc will now produce warnings for bracketed links ([[target]]). Use {@link target} instead. The {@link} syntax will be recognized by TypeScript 4.3 and later and used to provide better intellisense. TypeDoc version 0.24.0 will remove support for [[target]] style links. Support for [[`links`]] with brackets + code ticks have been dropped.
extends in typedoc.json is now resolved using NodeJS module resolution, so a local path must begin with ./.
In the JSON output for DeclarationReflections, getSignature is no longer a one-tuple.
In the JSON output for DeclarationReflections, setSignature is no longer a one-tuple.
In the JSON output for DeclarationReflections, typeParameter has been renamed to typeParameters
The searchGroupBoosts option must now be given the rendered group name rather than reflection kind names, and can be given custom group names.
@inheritDoc now follows the behavior specified by TSDoc when copying comments with a reference.
The gaSite option has been removed since Google Analytics now infers the site automatically, updated Google Analytics script to latest version, #1846.
The hideLegend option has been removed as the default theme no longer contains a legend.
Comments on export declarations will only overrides comments for references and namespaces, #1901.
The deprecated listInvalidSymbolLinks option has been removed. Use validation.invalidLink instead.
The deprecated true and false values have been removed from --emit, to migrate replace true with "both" and false with "docs" (the default).
Links are no longer be resolved against a global list of all symbols. See the documentation for details on link resolution.
The validation.invalidLink option is now on by default.
reflection.decorates, reflection.decorators, and their corresponding interfaces have been removed as no code in TypeDoc used them.
The shape of the Comment class has changed significantly to support multiple tag kinds.
Listeners to Converter.EVENT_CREATE_TYPE_PARAMETER and Converter.EVENT_CREATE_DECLARATION will now never be passed a ts.Node as their third argument.
Constant variables which are interpreted as functions will no longer have the ReflectionFlag.Const flag set.
reflection.defaultValue is no longer set for enum members. The same information is available on reflection.type with more precision.
Removed deprecated removeReaderByName, addDeclarations and removeDeclarationByName methods on Options.
Removed ProjectReflection.directory, it was unused by TypeDoc and not properly tested.
Removed ProjectReflection.files, this was an internal cache that should not have been exposed, and shouldn't have existed in the first place, since removing it made TypeDoc faster.
Removed ReflectionGroup.kind since groups can now be created with the @group tag.
Removed ReflectionKind.Event, the @event tag is now an alias for @group Events. Note: This changes the value of ReflectionKind.Reference from 16777216 to 8388608.
Themes are now set on the document element rather than on body, #1706.
Features
TypeDoc now supports the @group tag to group reflections in a page. If no @group tag is specified, reflections will be grouped according to their kind, #1652.

TypeDoc will now search for typedoc.js(on) in the .config folder in the current working directory.

Entry point strategies Resolve and Expand may now specify globs, #1926.

typedoc.json now supports comments like tsconfig.json.

TypeDoc will now read the blockTags, inlineTags, and modifierTags out of tsdoc.json in the same directory as tsconfig.json if it exists. It is recommended to add "extends": ["typedoc/tsdoc.json"], which defines TypeDoc specific tags to your tsdoc.json if you create one.

If an exported symbol has multiple declarations, TypeDoc will now check all appropriate declarations for comments, and warn if more than one declaration contains a comment, #1855.

Improved support for JSDoc style @example tags. If the tag content does not include a code block, TypeDoc now follows VSCode's behavior of treating the entire block as a code block, #135.

TypeDoc will now render members marked with @deprecated with a line through their name, #1381.

Added new commentStyle option which can be used to control what comments TypeDoc will parse.

Value Behavior
JSDoc Use block comments starting with /\*\*
Block Use all block comments
Line Use // comments
All Use both block and line comments
TypeDoc will now warn if part of a comment will be overwritten due to use of @inheritDoc instead of silently dropping part of the comment.

Added support for inline @inheritDoc tags, #1480.

It is now possible to link directly to a specific overload, #1326.

The JSON output will now include URLs to the file on the remote repository if possible.

Added a new visibilityFilters option which controls the available filters on a page.

TypeDoc will now try to place block elements on a new line in HTML output, resulting in less overwhelming diffs when rebuilding docs, #1923.

Added blockTags, inlineTags, modifierTags to control which tags TypeDoc will allow when parsing comments. If a tag not in in one of these options is encountered, TypeDoc will produce a warning and use context clues to determine how to parse the tag.

Bug Fixes
Fixed off by one error in warnings for types referenced but not included in the documentation.
TypeDoc will no longer render a Type Parameters heading if there are no type parameters in some cases.

JS exports defined as exports.foo = ... will now be converted as variables rather than properties.
searchCategoryBoosts are now correctly computed for all categories, #1960.
The excludeNotDocumented option will no longer hide a module if it has a documentation comment, #1948.
Prevent --excludeNotDocumented from hiding properties of type literals (a in function fn(p: { a: string })), #1752.
Allow cts and mts extensions in packages resolution mode, #1952.

v0.22.9 (2021-11-14)
Features
TypeDoc will now detect and warn if multiple instances of the package are loaded. This usually means that a plugin has its own version of TypeDoc installed, which will lead to things breaking in unexpected ways. It will only work if both loaded TypeDocs are v0.22.9 or later.
TypeDoc will now automatically load packages with typedoc-theme in their keywords. Plugins which define a custom theme should include this keyword so that they can be automatically collected and displayed at https://typedoc.org/guides/themes/.
