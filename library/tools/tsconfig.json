/*

I am using linux nodejs typescript
I will take a screen capture of each screen (monitors) separately and have one (png) image of the corect size and change the size of teh other image and do a script with node js to change the sizes and put both in a resuting composit image
I need a self contained script (nodejs typescript) and not using canvas that would receive the path of the left image (probably a .png) followed bit the right image path to the other .png image if both are valid images I would like to composite them into a resulting image I would like to get the resulting composit image to be saved to the disk
I need a shebang please name it merge-two-screens.ts

the config files will be in the /projects/monorepo-one/library/tools folder and the script would be in the /projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/create-composite-screenshot/merge-two-screens.ts file I am unsing import instead of require
